## The mission
The company Hackers Poulette â„¢ sells Raspberry Pi accessory kits to build your own. They want to allow their users to contact their support team. Your mission is to create a fully-functioning online "contact support" form, in PHP. It must display a contact form and process the received answer (sanitize, validate, answer the user).
